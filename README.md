# Olympians
Compilation of the different bots for the Discord Server Maelstrom. **This project has been abandoned.**

## Who are the Olympians?
The 12 most important ancient Greek gods were called the Olympians. For now I have 4 of them: Zeus, Apollo, Athena and Dionysus. I have given them functions that resemble what they are god of. For example:
```
Zeus is god of Law, Justice and Order. He takes care of muting, bans,
kicks, general order on the server and usage control.
```

## Note
1. These bots were made specifically for the Maelstrom Discord server. It could be that there are hardcoded ID's and such in the code. I can recognise these id's mostly, but to you they probably mean nothing.
2. I don't mind you looking at these files and getting ideas from it, but please don't blatantly copy the code.

If you have any questions, send me an email.
